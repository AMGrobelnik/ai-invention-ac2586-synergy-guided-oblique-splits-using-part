  "title": "SG-FIGS Eval",
  "summary": "Seven-block statistical evaluation of SG-FIGS experiment results across 12 datasets and 6 methods. Block 1: Per-dataset accuracy/AUC tables with Bonferroni-corrected paired t-tests (15 pairs). Block 2: Friedman test (\u03c7\u00b2=34.79, p=1.66e-6) and Nemenyi CD=2.176 with clique identification. Block 3: Spearman correlations between SG-FIGS-25 advantage and 7 dataset properties (synergy stability \u03c1=0.378, n_samples \u03c1=0.483). Block 4: Oblique split activation analysis revealing 3-4 datasets with complete degeneration per SG-FIGS variant. Block 5: Accuracy-at-matched-complexity curves across max_rules={5,10,15} with sign test. Block 6: Ablation decomposition showing 50% of datasets have synergy_hurts, 33% oblique_harmful. Block 7: Positive case studies for segment (+3.4%), australian (+4.6%), ionosphere (+0.2%) with domain-meaningfulness ratings. Output: 360 examples (12 datasets \u00d7 6 methods \u00d7 5 folds), 19 eval metrics per example, validated against exp_eval_sol_out schema."
